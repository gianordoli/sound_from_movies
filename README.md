# Visualizing Sound from Movies

MFA Design and Technology, Parsons The New School for Design

Thesis Studio 1

Fall, 2014

---

[This prototype](http://54.204.173.108/parsons/thesis_1/sound_from_movies/) is a visual comparison of sound and character lines from 2 movies: *City of Angels* and *Wings of Desire*. It is an attempt to:

* Apply Lev Manovich’s method from [“Visualizing Vertov”](http://lab.softwarestudies.com/2013/01/visualizing-vertov-new-article-by-lev.html) to sound, instead of shots.
* Determine if/how patterns emerge from a sound analysis of a movie.
